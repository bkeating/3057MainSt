Managing my home renovations and maintenence as a software project. [#HowBuildingsLearn](https://www.amazon.com/How-Buildings-Learn-Happens-Theyre/dp/0140139966)

I encourage you to keep a repo of your dwelling(s). Keep diagrams, project quotes, garden plans, home repairs, and other related items that you and future owners can use, learn and measure from. File issues. Use Project kanbans to manage projects. Encourage Your family to join in.

Buildings do indeed learn.

It feels dumb at first. You wont feel encouraged whatsoever, but as the years pass it becomes precious. You gain a stronger understanding of how time plays out in a way I have yet to experience elsewhere.
